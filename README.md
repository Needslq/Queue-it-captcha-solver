Queue-it is a platform that provides solutions for managing online traffic during high demand situations. It offers three types of CAPTCHA tools to help mitigate bots and abuse: Google ReCAPTCHA, Google ReCAPTCHA Invisible, and Queue-it CAPTCHA.

1. **Google ReCAPTCHA**: This tool uses visitor actions, such as clicking an "I'm not a robot" checkbox or solving an image puzzle, to distinguish genuine visitors from malicious or fake traffic.
2. **Google ReCAPTCHA Invisible**: This implementation uses a machine learning risk analysis engine to flag suspicious users who must solve a CAPTCHA challenge, allowing trustworthy traffic to pass through.
3. **Queue-it CAPTCHA**: This is an alternative to Google's reCAPTCHA for blocking bots and abuse. Visitors can solve the CAPTCHA by entering the code from an image or audio recording. It is built on a well-established solution from BotDetect and fully hosted by Queue-it's infrastructure for scalability, reliability, and availability where reCAPTCHA is not an option. It is fully GDPR compliant as it only tracks user behavior directly related to the legitimate interest of confirming the user isn‚Äôt a bot.
To use these CAPTCHA tools in your Queue-it waiting rooms, you need to have the Bots & Abuse feature on your Queue-it subscription. You can then choose the CAPTCHA setting you prefer on the Bots and Abuse tab of your waiting room settings.
